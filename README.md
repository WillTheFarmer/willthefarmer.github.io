Current purpose of this repository is to promote `log-files-to-mysql` & `mysql-schema-http-logs` repositories and in development `mysql-to-apache-echarts` 
repository on search engines by implementing Search Engine Optimization (SEO). 

To keep Python, SQL and Typescript code repositories simple and light shared images and screenshots in this repository. Discussion Links used in repositories:

Python - [log-files-to-mysql](https://github.com/willthefarmer/log-files-to-mysql)

SQL & DDL - [mysql-schema-http-logs](https://github.com/willthefarmer/mysql-schema-http-logs)

SQL & DDL - [mysql-schema-system-logs](https://github.com/willthefarmer/mysql-schema-system-logs)

Typescript - [mysql-to-apache-echarts](https://github.com/willthefarmer/mysql-to-apache-echarts)

## HTTP Log Parser and Data Normalization Application
[log-files-to-mysql](https://github.com/willthefarmer/log-files-to-mysql) consists of two Python Modules & one Database Schema that parse and import 
Access & Error log files and normalizes data into database designed for reports & data analysis.

Application automates consolidation of log files from multiple Servers and unlimited Domains with audit trail & error logging.
### Python handles File Processing & MySQL or MariaDB handles Data Processing

## HTTP Log Management and Visualization Application
[mysql-to-apache-echarts](https://github.com/willthefarmer/mysql-to-apache-echarts) is a Web interface that consists of Express.js web application 

frameworks with Drill Down Capability & Apache ECharts frameworks for Log Data Visualization in charts, reports & data analysis 
interfaces of MySQL or MariaDB databases.

The MySQL or MariaDB databases created by [mysql-schema-http-logs](https://github.com/willthefarmer/mysql-schema-http-logs)
and [mysql-schema-system-logs](https://github.com/willthefarmer/mysql-schema-system-logs)
and populated by [log-files-to-mysql](https://github.com/willthefarmer/log-files-to-mysql) .

### Express handles Data Querying & ECharts handles Data Visualization of MySQL or MariaDB Schema
